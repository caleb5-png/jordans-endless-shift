# The Backrooms: Jordan's Endless Shift

A small browser survival-horror game built for desktop and mobile.

## Play

Live game: https://caleb5-png.github.io/jordans-endless-shift/

## Goal

Explore the maze, repair every generator, survive the monster's mutations, and catch it once the power is restored.

## Modes

- **Campaign:** Progress through maps in order and unlock each new level.
- **Normal:** Choose Easy, Normal, or Hard for the original single-round game.
- **Normal and Campaign:** Choose any unlocked map. Boilerworks has a small chance to contain two cooperating monsters.
- **Endless:** Every cleared round immediately starts a harder one. New rounds add generators, speed, mutations, stronger events, and eventually more monsters.
- **Survival:** Choose the existing monster roster, number of monsters, difficulty, generators, mutation count, and whether events are active.

The main menu is intentionally compact: **Play**, **Shop**, **Info**, **Records**, and **Settings**. Records combines statistics, cosmetics, map collection, and daily objectives. Loadouts are selected during run setup, and Survival settings use that same setup flow.

**Optimization Mode** is available in Settings for older computers. It reduces visual detail and draws the game at approximately 30 FPS while keeping the game simulation running normally.

## Controls

### Desktop

- WASD: move
- E: interact with a nearby generator
- Space: use Adrenaline or hit a skill check
- F: use a Flashbang
- Hold Shift: crouch and slow the chase
- Hold B: hold your breath from All-Seeing
- H: hide near a hiding spot (20 seconds)
- N: use a Noise Maker
- T: place a Bear Trap

### Phone

Use the virtual joystick and the four on-screen buttons:

- **E:** interact with generators, fuses, rooms, and hiding spots.
- **Abilities:** opens crouch, hold breath, and hide. Crouch is a toggle on phone.
- **Items:** opens Adrenaline, Flashbang, Noise Maker, and Emergency Battery.
- **Skill Check:** appears during timing-based generator repairs; tap it when the needle is in the green zone.

The Abilities and Items panels safely pause the run while they are open. The Skill Check button appears in the spare action slot only during timing repairs. For the best experience, open the live game in Safari or Chrome and add it to the Home Screen. Launching it from the icon enables the cleanest app-like display and offline play after the first online load.

## Progression and atmosphere

- Cosmetic player colors and trails are unlocked by challenges such as winning on Hard, catching specific monsters, clearing Endless rounds, and winning without items.
- The Statistics screen tracks games, wins, repairs, catches, Endless progress, item use, and favorite monster.
- Inventory is limited to five consumables total. The shop includes Adrenaline, Flashbangs, Noise Makers, Bear Traps, Emergency Batteries, and Breath Filters.
- Bear Traps can be placed with **T** or from the mobile Items menu. They briefly stun a monster and disappear after triggering; only two can be active at once.
- When more than one monster is active, the HUD identifies the group and offers a **MONSTERS** roster with each monster's mutations.
- Hallucination mutations can create fake silhouettes, generator signals, alerts, and HUD readings without directly harming the player.
- The Boilerworks map uses long procedural industrial halls, three cooling valves, heat zones, and a central boiler objective. Aeson is most likely to spawn there.
- The Crimson Containment is a larger procedural red industrial facility. Rhys patrols it with short-range goop and straight-line dashes. Restore power, complete the generated seal route (direct, key-and-chest, or cracked wall), arm the containment trap, and lure him in. Its alarm, pressure release, seal resonance, and expanding emergency-light sweep events replace normal power outages.
- The Endless Hotel is assembled from connected rooms, hallways, and hotel wings. Repair its generators, accept up to two genuine staff assignments, complete and report them, then evacuate the staff through the elevator before catching Bassam.
- Hotel Lockdown seals a complete corridor width temporarily with a valid alternate route. Bassam roams in disguise, can give a false assignment, and only reveals himself after leaving the player’s view. Mutations can add false objectives, echoes, camera pressure, unstable skill checks, longer lockdowns, and afterimages.
- Daily objectives award local bonus tokens, and loadouts choose which owned consumable types are available during a run.

The info screen inside the game lists every mobile button and the special map events, generators, rooms, and mutations.

## Progress and saves

Progress is saved locally on each device. The game keeps a versioned save and a rotating backup. Use **Settings** to export a JSON save file, import a backup, or reset progress. Campaign unlocks, daily objectives, and loadout selection are included. No account or cloud save is required.
